# Presents of Mind
Senior Project by Alex DeFiore, Alexis Fatica, and Zach Janice

The web application was constructed and tested in an Ubuntu environment (16.04) using the tools Flask, Jinja2, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Amazon’s Python API for product searching, LXML, Stemming, NumPy, and SKLearn. Respectively, the following commands can be run to install these dependencies in the Ubuntu environment such that the server and its tools are ready to run:

sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install Flask
sudo pip install Jinja2
sudo apt-get install postgresql
sudo pip install SQLAlchemy
sudo pip install python-amazon-product-api
sudo pip install lxml
sudo pip install stemming
sudo pip install numpy
sudo pip install sklearn
Sudo pip install psycopg2
Sudo pip install scipy

As a result of running these commands in terminal, the dependencies needed for the server’s operation are downloaded and ready for use, with the exception of Amazon’s API.

A detailed Programmer's Manual is available in section 9.3.
